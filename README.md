# [Timezone.io](http://timezone.io)

Timezone is an application aimed at helping remote teams by making it easier
to see where and **when** their coworkers are.

# Setup

Install all the deps and gulp globally:

```shell
$ npm i
$ npm i -g gulp
```

To start the server and restart on changes, use nodemon:
```shell
nodemon
```

In a separate shell, watch for changes to the files and automatically 
re-browserify the bundles:
```shell
gulp watch
```
