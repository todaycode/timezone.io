# Contributing

Anyone can contribute to Timezone! I'd love for all types of people to
contribute: developers, designers, product-minded people, marketers or whatever
you consider yourself. Suggest features, create mock ups, fix bugs or improve
copy. All contribution is encouraged.

First and foremost, this project should be a place welcome to all. Be nice.
Any harmful language and disrespectful language will not be tolerated. Docker
does a fantastic way of communicating this, please checkout out [their
wonderful community guidelines](https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#docker-community-guidelines).

At the start of this project's open source journey, I'm not 100% sure how
the product development will flow. To start off, here's a basic idea of how
it will work:

## Bug fixes, documentation, optimizations
If you have a bug fix or are doing something like adding more documentation feel
free to open a pull request. Either myself or someone can help test or verify
the change and it will be merged into the project for the next deploy.

## New features and design changes
For features or other subjective things like design changes, please first add
an issue on Github describing the feature, including any wireframes or design
mock ups if you want. It would be great to do a check to see if the feature
idea or change feels like something good for Timezone.io before contributors
do a bunch of coding work! Github issues will also be a great place to discuss
how we might tackle a feature, ex. how to structure our data for a new model
or work on design iterations.

## How do I get started?
Go check out existing issues on github and if you'd like to build something
feel free to comment on the issue and claim it. Don't see what you want to do
in the issues? Go ahead and create one and try to explain your idea as best you
can. Still not sure how to get started? That's ok! Contact me on Twitter at
[@djfarelly](https://twitter.com/djfarrelly).

## Writing code + Style guide
When submitting a pull request for the project please try to stay within the
general style of the code in the project. For JavaScript, reference the
amazing [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
and for CSS/Stylus you can reference Nicolas Gallager's
[Idiomatic CSS](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css).
